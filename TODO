- Create a method of extending an FSM between components.
- Extensions to the FSM should be tested semi-independently of the parent FSM. Ex: duplicate transitions can occur between the parent and all extensions.

EX:
StateManager.create(
	...
	extensions: [
		Extension(
			managedValues: [],
			stateTransitions: [],
			stateActions: [],
			optimisticTransitions: true | false
		)
	]
);
